    <h3>Features of JavaScript</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Lightweight and interpreted</b> - line by line execution</li>
      <li>
        <b>Dynamic typing</b> - variables can be reassigned with different data
        types
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> First-class functions </b>- functions can be passed as arguments,
        returned from other functions, and assigned to variables
      </li>
      <li>loose typed - no need to declare data types explicitly</li>
      <li>
        <b>Prototype-based inheritance</b> - objects inherit properties and
        methods from prototypes
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> Event-driven programming </b>- JavaScript is event-driven, meaning
        it responds to events like clicks, key presses, and other user
        interactions
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>single-threaded</b> - JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can
        only execute one task at a time
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>synchronous but we can use Asynchronous programming</b> - JavaScript
        supports asynchronous programming through callbacks, promises, and
        async/await syntax
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cross-platform compatibility</b> - JavaScript can run on various
        platforms, including web browsers, servers, and mobile devices
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Rich ecosystem</b> - JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries,
        frameworks, and tools that make development easier and more efficient
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>high-level language</b> - JavaScript abstracts away low-level
        details, making it easier to write and understand code
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    diffrence between java and javascript <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        Java is a statically typed, compiled language, while JavaScript is a
        dynamically typed, interpreted language.
      </li>
      <li>
        Java is primarily used for server-side development, while JavaScript is
        primarily used for client-side web development.
      </li>
      <li>
        Java code needs to be compiled before it can be run, while JavaScript
        code can be executed directly in a web browser or on a server using
        Node.js.
      </li>
      <li>
        Java has a more complex syntax and is generally considered more
        difficult to learn than JavaScript, which has a simpler syntax and is
        often recommended for beginners.
      </li>
      <li>
        Java has a strong emphasis on object-oriented programming, while
        JavaScript supports multiple programming paradigms, including
        object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming.
      </li>
    </ul>
    diffrence between high level and low level programming language <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        High-level programming languages are designed to be easy for humans to
        read and write, while low-level programming languages are closer to
        machine code and are more difficult for humans to understand.
      </li>
      <li>
        High-level languages abstract away many of the details of the underlying
        hardware, while low-level languages require programmers to manage memory
        and other system resources directly.
      </li>
      <li>
        High-level languages typically have built-in libraries and frameworks
        that make development faster and easier, while low-level languages
        require programmers to write more code from scratch.
      </li>
      <li>
        High-level languages are generally slower than low-level languages
        because they require more processing power to execute, while low-level
        languages can be optimized for performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        High-level languages are often used for application development, while
        low-level languages are used for system programming and embedded
        systems.
      </li>
